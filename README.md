# SVG-Logo-Generator-10

## Description

The motivation behind this SVG logo generator in node.js using inquirer with test using JEST was to be able to create basic SVG logos to use in Projects. Another big motivator was to put some of the skills I've learned
using node.js such as inquirer to prompt the user questions in the Command Line Interface, Class constructors
and inheritance, tests using JEST, and using some of the built in modules of node.js such as FS. 

## Installation

The steps required to use this APP is to download the files, open them in the node.js environment, 
and use the command line interface (CLI) to start the program. You start the program by installing any
programs/packages in the package.json file by using the following CLI command: "npm i". 
Then you would start the program by typing the following CLI command: "node index.js". You will
then be prompted to answer questions about how you would like you SVG logo to look. 

## License

MIT license. 

## Tests

If you would like to run test using JEST, all you need to do is write test in the shapes.test.js file and then run
them in the CLI using the following command: "npm test". 
The program already comes with built in tests for the classes CIRLE, TRIANGLE, AND RECTANGLE. These
tests validate that the render method in each of these classes returns the correct svg logo with the
correct input that was passed in using inquirer.
